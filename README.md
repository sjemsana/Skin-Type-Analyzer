# Skin Type Analyzer Landing Page (HTML/CSS/JS)

## Description
Built a landing page to demonstrate core front-end competencies (HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript user interaction) for a basic web-based quiz. This project fulfils the requirements of the SheCodes "Introduction to Coding" certification.

## Key Learning
The main challenge was ensuring the JavaScript logic correctly validated the user's age and successfully executed the nested if/else flow to provide a basic personalized result, showcasing my systemic problem-solving approach.

## Technologies Used:
HTML5 (Semantic Tags), CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (Template Literals, if/else, prompt, alert, and Event Listeners).
